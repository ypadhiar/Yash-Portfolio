  <h1 style="text-align:center" id="about-me">About Me</h1>
  <p>Hello there! I'm Yash, a fellow Western University student with a passion for programming. I very recently discovered this passion in high school, when a friend 
    showed me a game he made with some rudimentary Java code. When I'm not studying or attending classes, you can usually find me playing video games or socializing with my friends. 
    I like spending time with my friends because we crack a lot of jokes and it makesÂ me laugh uncontrollably. Every week, I want to try something new and see whether I like it. I've 
    recently started reading books again because I haven't done so in a long time (I hate reading).</p>

        <h2>Merchandising Associate</h2>
        <p class="title">Summer 2023</p>
        <p>My position at Walmart as a merchandising associate involves making our customer's shopping experience enjoyable. I take delight 
          in making sure that our shelves are supplied with goods, that our displays are organized, and that the products are easy to find.
 My daily responsibilities include ensuring pricing correctness, maintaining the general aesthetic of the store, and examining the quality and 
 freshness of the products. I'm dedicated to making sure that our consumers have a simple time locating what they require and enjoy their 
 purchasing experience. I help consumers find products and put up advertising signs, among other things. I get to help Walmart succeed by 
 maximizing product placement and presentation through my work.</p>

        <h2>Picker/Packer</h2>
        <p class="title">Summer 2022</p>
        <p>My position as a picker/packer in the Handicare warehouse is essential to making sure that orders are completed precisely and quickly. I am 
          in charge of choosing goods from authorized storage places, carefully examining them for quality, and then packing them in a way that 
          complies with packaging regulations. I often identify and collect products using devices like portable scanners or order-picking systems. 
          In order to make sure that the right items are picked for each transaction, attention to detail is essential in my line of work. In order 
          to support a seamless and dependable distribution process, it is my responsibility to ensure that orders are prepared precisely and on schedule. 
          Precision, quickness, and attention to prescribed protocols are crucial in this position to uphold the high standards anticipated in a warehouse 
          environment. </p>
